# Best Flowise Alternatives in 2024 to Build AI Agents

AI agents have recently captured the attention of everyone. These are digital entities that follow instructions to accomplish their assigned objectives. The popularity of artificial intelligence agents has led to the development of platforms that individuals can use to build these digital entities. 

# Flowise AI

A platform that has received significant attention is Flowise. With FlowiseAI, you can create LLM flows and LangChain applications using a drag-and-drop interface. In addition to chatbots and virtual assistants, it also provides data analysis tools, as well as artificial intelligence agents. FlowiseAI is based on LangChain.js and provides a highly sophisticated Graphic User Interface that is perfectly suited to the seamless development of LLM-based applications. 

This ecosystem encompasses a number of distinct building blocks, such as Prompt Engineering, Agents, Chaining, Semantic Search, Chat Models, Vector Stores, and an array of tools that can be assigned to agents for specific functions. That’s the essence of Flowise. (If you want to learn more, you can find additional information about Flowise here.) However, this blog aims to explore alternatives to Flowise for building AI agents. So, let’s dive straight into our list.

# LangFlow

In a similar manner to Flowise AI, Langflow allows you to design LangChain flows as well. Using its drag-and-drop feature, you can easily experiment, and the chat interface allows you to communicate in real-time. You can edit prompt parameters, build chains and agents, follow thought processes, and export flows using this application.

The process of using LangFlow is quite straightforward. You can create a pipeline by dragging components from the sidebar onto the canvas and connecting them. As part of LangFlow, there are various LangChain components such as LLMs, prompt serializers, agents, and chains. In the same manner as Flowise AI, LangFlow also offers an online marketplace where you can access examples and templates. 


# Dify

Dify.AI is a user-friendly platform designed as an Open-Source Assistant API and an alternative to GPTs. As a platform for developing applications for Large Language Models (LLMs), it integrates Backend as a Service and LLMOps concepts. This platform covers the core technology stack required to build generative AI-native applications and includes a built-in RAG engine. The platform provides access to various LLMs such as Anthropic, OpenAI, Llama 2, and more.
