# Best Flowise Alternatives in 2024 to Build AI Agents

AI agents have recently captured the attention of everyone. These are digital entities that follow instructions to accomplish their assigned objectives. The popularity of artificial intelligence agents has led to the development of platforms that individuals can use to build these digital entities. 

# Flowise AI

A platform that has received significant attention is Flowise. With FlowiseAI, you can create LLM flows and LangChain applications using a drag-and-drop interface. In addition to chatbots and virtual assistants, it also provides data analysis tools, as well as artificial intelligence agents. FlowiseAI is based on LangChain.js and provides a highly sophisticated Graphic User Interface that is perfectly suited to the seamless development of LLM-based applications. 

This ecosystem encompasses a number of distinct building blocks, such as Prompt Engineering, Agents, Chaining, Semantic Search, Chat Models, Vector Stores, and an array of tools that can be assigned to agents for specific functions. That’s the essence of Flowise. (If you want to learn more, you can find additional information about Flowise here.) However, this blog aims to explore alternatives to Flowise for building AI agents. So, let’s dive straight into our list.

# LangFlow

In a similar manner to Flowise AI, Langflow allows you to design LangChain flows as well. Using its drag-and-drop feature, you can easily experiment, and the chat interface allows you to communicate in real-time. You can edit prompt parameters, build chains and agents, follow thought processes, and export flows using this application.

The process of using LangFlow is quite straightforward. You can create a pipeline by dragging components from the sidebar onto the canvas and connecting them. As part of LangFlow, there are various LangChain components such as LLMs, prompt serializers, agents, and chains. In the same manner as Flowise AI, LangFlow also offers an online marketplace where you can access examples and templates. 


# Dify

Dify.AI is a user-friendly platform designed as an Open-Source Assistant API and an alternative to GPTs. As a platform for developing applications for Large Language Models (LLMs), it integrates Backend as a Service and LLMOps concepts. This platform covers the core technology stack required to build generative AI-native applications and includes a built-in RAG engine. The platform provides access to various LLMs such as Anthropic, OpenAI, Llama 2, and more.


# Flowise AI vs LangFlow

Flowise and LangFlow are both powerful tools for building AI applications using a drag-and-drop interface, but they have some key differences. Here's a breakdown to help you decide which might be best for you:

# Strengths of Flowise

1- Easier to learn and use: Flowise has a simpler interface and more pre-built templates, making it quicker to get started, especially for beginners.

2- Stronger deployment options: Flowise offers built-in deployment options for platforms like Docker and Railway, making it easier to get your application online.

3- Predefined agents for complex tasks: Flowise offers pre-built agents for tasks like conversation flows and API integration, which can save you time and effort.

# Weaknesses of Flowise

1- Less customization: Flowise offers less flexibility and customization compared to LangFlow.

2- Currently local-only: Flowise applications can't be deployed remotely in the cloud yet.

3- Fewer advanced features: Flowise lacks some advanced features found in LangFlow, such as code integration and custom embedding options.


# Strengths of LangFlow

1- More powerful and flexible: LangFlow offers greater customization and flexibility, allowing you to build more complex and sophisticated applications.

2- Advanced features: LangFlow has features like code integration, custom embedding options, and a wider range of memory options.

3- Cloud-based: LangFlow applications can be deployed in the cloud for easy access and collaboration.

# Weaknesses of LangFlow

1- Steeper learning curve: LangFlow's interface can be more complex to learn and use than Flowise, especially for beginners.

2- No built-in deployment options: You need to set up your own deployment for LangFlow applications.

3- Fewer pre-built templates: LangFlow relies more on creating your own flows from scratch, which can be time-consuming.

# Ultimately, the best choice for you depends on your needs and experience:

## Choose Flowise if:

- You're new to building AI applications.
- You need to get your application up and running quickly.
- You need an easy-to-use platform with pre-built templates.

## Choose LangFlow if:

- You need a more powerful and flexible platform.
- You're comfortable with code and advanced features.
- You need to deploy your application in the cloud.

# Possible Error in Flowise AI:

When using the Flowise AI, ""flowise"  PDFDocument: stream must have data" may be seen. However, it can be solved by adding this line of code in the ..\flowiseAI\Flowise\docker\.env file:

'''
FLOWISE_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT=50mb
'''

There is a default limitation of 2mb for files. This line of code increases this limitation.
